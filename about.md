### About us
My group works at the intersection of clinical research, biomedical informatics and molecular biology to understand the how breastfeeding impacts maternal and infant health outcomes. Active projects in the lab are thematically organized around 1) participant recruitment, 2) human milk metabolomics, 3) infant microbiome, 4) mom-baby linked electronic health records.  If you are interested in working in my lab, please send me an email with your interests.

### Research
BIG DATA has revolutionaized biomedical research and has ushered in the era of precision health. My research program investigates breastfeeding and precsion health from two angles 1) precision public health and 2) precision medicine. 

1) Precsion Public Health and Breastfeeding Outcomes. The goal of this project is to leverage natural language processing to extract structured breastfeeding data from clinical notes in electronic health records to estimate geospatial patterns in breastfeeding outcomes. This translational impact of this project is devoted to facilitate a better understanding of the local geospatial and sociodemographic disparities in breastfeeding outcomes and identify social determinants of health that can be targeted for future precision public health interventions. 

2) Precison Medicine and Microbe-Host Interactions. This goal of this project is to characterize the functional relationships between breastfeeding, the gut microbiome, and pediatric obesity. Briefly, my K01 project is actively recruiting a cohort of normoglycemic pregnant mothers and following these maternal-infant dyads through the first year of life as part of the IRB-approved Breastfeeding and EArly Child Health (BEACH) study. The purpose of the BEACH study is to leverage un-targeted metabolomics to identify human milk compounds that stabilize a healthy infant microbiome and are associated with infant growth during a critical window of development. The translational impact of this project is to develop low-cost dietary interventions for pregnant overweight/obese mothers that target microbial-derived compounds in human milk with therapeutic potential to attenuate the transmission of obesity risk from mother to child.
